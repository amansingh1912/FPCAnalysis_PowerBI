### [Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KtWlUp6wZGUORTC-oPbCOuFtRXu7FREePdNDTk-8BII/edit?usp=sharing)

## Requirements of the report:
Requirement of the report was to put a detailed description of shareholder's details and analyse the feedbacks given by the shareholders.

### Tools Used: PowerBI, Figma, Logomakr.com

After loading the dataset in Power BI, I applied the following applications...

## Understanding the Data:
The dataset contains details like name of the shareholder, shareholder's (age, land owned, education, village, district, crops grown, no. of cows, no. of buffaloes,
Rating on FPC, etc.)
Based on these parameters, I analyzed the data.

## Application of DAX measures:
During the making of dashboard, I applied the following DAX measures (DISTINCTCOUNT, CALCULATE, COUNTROWS, COUNT) to find "Total Districts", "Total Shareholders",
"Total Villages" and "% Connection with Commission Agents".

## Visualization in Power BI:
I splitted the report mainly in 2 pages which are:

* Overview
* Detailed Analysis

* Overview page contains details like Total Districts, Sample Size, Total Villages, %connection with local agents, age range variation, etc.
* Detailed Analysis page contains factors affecting PFC and charts based on it.


## Theme and Color Palette:
* Background color used for the dashboard is green.
* Colors used: shades of green, white and grey.

## Visualization:

Here, I used Figma for creating layout for background which is 16:9 i.e. 720* 1280px

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a good dataset to analyse and it gave me a good understanding regarding FPC shareholders and their details.
